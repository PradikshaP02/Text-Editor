Description of the project:
A text editor is used to edit plain text files. Text editors differ from word processors, such as Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, in that they do not add additional formatting information to documents.
This project mainly focuses on the concept of organised text. 
Implemented this using stack data structure.
The features of this project include:
 	- Create
 	- Display
 	- Undo
 	- Redo
 	- Append
 	- Delete
Create is generating a new file in write mode and writing some data into it.
Display is opening the file in read mode and delivering the content of the same.
The undo function is used to reverse a mistake, such as deleting the wrong word in a sentence. 
The redo function restores any actions that were previously undone using an undo.
Append is used to add some data into the existing file.
Delete is either used to delete the file or to remove some data in the file
